<h1 style="color:#126e1b;">Trees</h1>
Over the course of the last year I have put significant work into the understanding and care of the trees within my section of Central Park. To formalize my knowledge I became an ISA certified arborist and began work inventorying the tree species around me.

<h3 style="color:#126e1b;">North Meadow Eastern Tree Map</h3>
This is an inventory of trees within the nearly 13 acre section of the Park I care for. This work was started in early July to help characterize the community type I work in. 
While I have catalogued ~75 - 80% of the trees within the area, I still have significant work left. Ideally this map would include DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) measurements and height estimations of each tree.
